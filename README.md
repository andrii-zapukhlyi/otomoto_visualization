I scraped car attributes from the otomoto.pl, visualized the results, and built car price prediction models. Each record in the dataset represents a specific sales offer on the platform. <br>

The analysis led to the identification of key pricing factors. The best model achieved an R-squared value of 0.92, providing a high-quality model for price prediction <br>
